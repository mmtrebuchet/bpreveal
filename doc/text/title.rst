BPReveal is a suite of tools for working with sequence-to-profile models in the vein of
BPNet.

It incorporates bias correction in the style of chrombpnet-lite, but with added features
to regress out very complex biases.

You can get your own copy of BPReveal from the project's
`GitHub page <https://github.com/mmtrebuchet/bpreveal>`_.

It also incorporates a new interpretation tool, called :doc:`PISA<_generated/pisa>`
(Pairwise Interaction Shap Analysis) that lets you view a two-dimensional map of cause
and effect over a region.

For a summary of the components of BPReveal, see :doc:`Programs<_generated/programs>`.
That section also has a list of some frequently-used API features.

#ifdef MAN_PAGE

**Man pages**

BPReveal contains a lot of code! This meta-man page contains
all of the documentation, but you can look up the documentation you
need in one of the pages relevant to the program you're using.

Here are the man pages included in BPReveal:

Section 1: MAN_PAGES_SECTION_1

Section 3: MAN_PAGES_SECTION_3

Section 7: MAN_PAGES_SECTION_7

You can use ``man motifScan`` to get documentation on the ``motifScan``
program, for example.
