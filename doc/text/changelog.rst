BPReveal 5.x
------------

BPReveal 5.1.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BPReveal 5.1.1, 2024-12-20
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

BUG FIXES:
    * trainSoloModel imported keras from tensorflow instead of directly, which caused
      the wrong version of the optimizer to be used when legacy keras support was enabled
      by an environment variable. (Bug reported by Giorgio.)
    * tensorflow-probability doesn't understand versions and can happily install a
      version with an incompatible tensorflow version. Releasing the version lock
      on tensorflow has fixed this for now. (Bug reported by Giorgio.)
    * pysam, pybedtools, and pybigwig are now installed through conda instead of pip.
      This makes the install quite a bit less painful in cases where pip would need to
      build a wheel. (Bug reported by Giorgio.)

CONTRIBUTORS:
    * Giorgion Ravanelli, for reporting the three bugs above and providing fixes.
    * Charles McAnany

BPReveal 5.1.0, 2024-12-13
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

BREAKING CHANGES:
    * Quite a bit of refactoring was done inside interpretUtils. While these
      functions are not normally directly useful for end-users, any custom interpretation
      pipeline is almost certainly going to need to be re-done. See the changes in
      interpretFlat and interpretPisa to see how to use the new API. There's also a demo
      of the new interpretation pipeline for custom metrics in ``doc/demos/testIsm.py``
    * ``shap.py`` and ``interpretUtils.py`` have moved to the ``internal/`` directory.

NEW FEATURES:
    * Added the ability to include random mutations in corruptors in
      :py:mod:`gaOptimize<bpreveal.gaOptimize>`. This is less useful
      for GA work but gives a nice tool for making systematic
      mutations (say, for marginalization).
    * You can now provide custom metrics for shapping, instead of
      just the built-in profile and counts metrics.
    * You can use scanning ISM instead of shap to get importance scores
      (though the implementation is very slow).

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * Added a way to completely silence all TensorFlow messages when using the batchers.
      This should only be used after you've tested your workflow, since it will also
      suppress all real errors. If TensorFlow 2.19 still emits megabytes of warnings,
      I may add this as a general feature to the CLI, probably as a new verbosity level.
    * Added a sans-serif option for all plots. This uses the Fira Sans font, which
      I find pleasant.
    * easyPredict can now use sequences that are longer than the model's input length.
      In this case, it will make predictions across the whole range of valid output
      and stitch them together to give you a single big output prediction.
    * interpretFlat now includes the value of the metric at each location that was
      interpreted in its output hdf5 file.
    * Since PISA graphs don't show any lines for low-importance connections,
      the color bar has been updated to be pure white within the region where
      no lines are drawn.

BUG FIXES:
    * Added a check to make sure that the slices applied to PISA plots are valid,
      previously a partial plot could be displayed if you sliced beyond the end of the
      PISA data. This emits an error message, but does not crash to maintain backwards
      compatibility. This will become a crash in 6.0.
    * The Keras race condition when loading a model was fixed upstream, and so I have
      removed the hacked solution from the BPReveal side.
    * Set pisa plots to always display whole pixels on the edge instead of the previous
      axis limit algorithm that could display half-pixels.
    * The addition of interactive plotting had broken ``use-annotation-colors`` in PISA
      graph generation. It now correctly colors the relevant lines again.
    * The switch to keras 3 caused losses to be logged twice during training,
      which filled up the window in showTrainingProgress. The extraneous losses
      have been silenced.

BPReveal 5.0.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BPReveal 5.0.2, 2024-11-06
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

BUG FIXES:
    * Fixed a rare segfault when very large input datasets are used to train.
      Thanks to Ivan for finding and helping to diagnose the bug!

CONTRIBUTORS:
    * Charles McAnany
    * Ivan Qiu


BPReveal 5.0.1, 2024-10-29
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

BUG FIXES:
    * Specified that the installer should use a tensorflow version before 2.18,
      since 2.18 has a serious regression on my machine that makes the GPU unusable.

BPReveal 5.0.0, 2024-09-25
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

BREAKING CHANGES:
    * The default value of ``correct-receptive-field`` in interpretPisa
      is now ``true``. It still issues a warning if you don't set it.
    * ``dumpModiscoSeqlets`` was removed.
    * The shap code was further trimmed down. The BPReveal shap code is really
      not intended for non-BPReveal models and you should use full-blown
      deepShap to interpret your own models.
    * Several breaking changes have arisen from the Keras 3.0 upgrade. For one
      thing, the loss components now have different names since they are
      actually metrics and not losses. I'm sure there are more gotchas waiting
      to be discovered.

NEW FEATURES:
    * A new tool was added that filters the output of other programs to get rid
      of garbage tensorflow warnings and messages. It can wrap another
      executable or be used as a filter on stdin.

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * The project now uses Tensorflow 2.17 with full-blown Keras 3.0. This
      means that models are now saved using the ``.keras`` extension. Old-style
      models will work albeit with some potential breakage.
    * Made the formatting for the bnf documentation more consistent.
    * Found a way to include the custom losses in the saved model, so you don't
      need to use custom_objects to load models any more. Of course, you should
      be using :py:func:`utils.loadModel<bpreveal.utils.loadModel>`.
    * The slurm tool now allows you to not specify the GPU type for an
      allocation. This is also now the default if you don't edit the
      ``gpuType`` entry in the configuration dictionary.

BUG FIXES:
    * Fixed an issue with how losses and metrics are calculated differently.
      This required adding a brand new callback to make the loss functions and
      the metrics mean the same thing.
    * Tons and tons of stuff to deal with Keras 3.0. Ugh.
    * Fixed a deadlock where a consumer of a queue could crash and cause the
      producer thread to hang, waiting for the queue to drain. Timeout errors
      now cause the underlying queue to ``cancel_join_thread()``, avoiding
      the deadlock.

DEPRECATIONS:
    * The addNoise tool is deprecated and will be removed in 6.0.0. It was
      never useful.

KNOWN ISSUES:
    * Keras has a bug that causes a race condition when loading models. This
      was patched in 3.5.0. In the meantime, I have added a lock that
      prevents multiple processes from loading a model simultaneously, but this
      only works when all of the readers are created by one master Python
      program, and not, for example, when using slurm to launch multiple jobs.

BPReveal 4.x
------------

BPReveal 4.3.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BPReveal 4.3.1, 2024-07-24
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

BUG FIXES:
    * Fixed a typo in the motifScan schema that prevented you from giving
      cutoff parameters to ``motifScan``. Added this as a new test case
      to the acceptance test.
CONTRIBUTORS:
    * Sam Campbell

BPReveal 4.3.0, 2024-06-24
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

BREAKING CHANGES:
    * Some of the arguments were renamed in various functions in
      :py:mod:`internal.plotUtils<bpreveal.internal.plotUtils>`.
      The arguments are now more consistent across the module.
    * To support interactive PISA plots and graphs, a few new arguments
      were added to functions in
      :py:mod:`internal.plotUtils<bpreveal.internal.plotUtils>`.
      The API of the :py:mod:`plotting<bpreveal.plotting>` module is unchanged.
    * Getting the schema to support numpy arrays has caused some tensorflow
      problems with glibc on one of my BPReveal installs. I was able to fix
      this by importing ``bpreveal.schema`` before importing anything from
      ``tensorflow``. This shouldn't affect you unless you were working with
      bpreveal.schema and tensorflow in the same script.
    * The implementation of the transformation model was changed, so if you were
      going inside the transformation model and messing with its layers,
      they're all different (and honestly simpler) now. This change has no
      effect on the outputs, and if you're not poking around at internal layers
      there should be no effect.

NEW FEATURES:
    * Added an interpreter for complex filter expressions to bestMotifsOnly.
    * Let the interpreter get totally out of hand. It is now Turing-complete
      since it supports lambdas and letrec-style function definition by abusing
      default argument notation. The interpreter is powerful enough to load a
      superset of JSON, and so it is now used to load all configuration files.
      This means that your configuration files can now contain things like list
      comprehensions and arithmetic expressions.

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * You can now specify a custom color map in
      :py:func:`plotPisa<bpreveal.plotting.plotPisa>` and
      :py:func:`plotPisaGraph<bpreveal.plotting.plotPisaGraph>`.
    * Added the ability to generate man pages for documentation.
      This required adding a preprocessor to the docstring processor;
      it is based on the C preprocessor, and has ``#define``, ``#undef``,
      ``#ifdef``, ``#ifndef``, ``#else``, and ``#endif``.
      BPReveal now adds itself to your man path when you activate it.
    * By specifying ``"output-gui": true`` in a configuration file for
      :py:mod:`makePisaFigure<bpreveal.makePisaFigure>`, you can have
      an interactive PISA plot that supports zooming.
    * Annotations on PISA graphs and plots can now have custom shapes.

BUG FIXES:
    * The schema for plots can now validate numpy arrays.
    * Fixed an issue in the implementation of Transformation models that prevented
      them from being shapped. You can now interpret transformation and combined models,
      but only ones that are trained with BPReveal 4.3.0 or later. (Older models that
      cannot be interpreted will now issue an informative error)
    * Related to the transformation model issue, the code would previously allow you
      to interpret a combined model, but during the calculation of shap values,
      only the residual component of the model was considered. This was a bug, and it
      now raises an error as it should.


BPReveal 4.2.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BPReveal 4.2.0, 2024-05-20
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

NEW FEATURES:
    * The old ``plots.py`` package in the tools directory has been re-worked and is
      now part of the main repo, under the name :py:mod:`plotting<bpreveal.plotting>`.
      A new type of plot, a PISA Graph Plot, has been added and the configuration
      for plotting is now based on a config dictionary instead of a sea of arguments.
      The old ``tools/plots.py`` file will remain until 6.0.0, but will not be
      maintained.
    * A new module, :py:mod:`colors<bpreveal.colors>` was added and it contains code
      for working with colors and the default color schemes for BPReveal.

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * Upgraded to Python 3.12 and Tensorflow 2.16. This required a bit of messing about
      with keras (BPReveal is still using the old Keras and won't switch until a major
      version goes by.)
    * The :py:func:`plotTraces<bpreveal.gaOptimize.plotTraces>` function now accepts
      color specs of the form used by the :py:mod:`colors<bpreveal.colors>` module.

BREAKING CHANGES:
    * The upgrade to Tensorflow 2.16 has not been seamless. If you want to import
      anything from Keras, you have to instead import tf_keras and deal with really
      spotty documentation.
    * Some of the type names in :py:mod:`gaOptimize<bpreveal.gaOptimize>` were changed
      to UPPER_CASE.

BPReveal 4.1.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BPReveal 4.1.4, 2024-04-24
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

NEW FEATURES:
    * Added a new tool, :py:mod:`shiftPisa<bpreveal.tools.shiftPisa>` that can
      shift PISA data forward and backward. This is very handy for MNase, since
      you can use it to align the 3' and 5' PISA data around the dyad.
    * Added a high-performance metapeak calculator,
      :py:func:`metapeak<bpreveal.bedUtils.metapeak>`.
ENHANCEMENTS:
    * :py:mod:`bestMotifsOnly<bpreveal.tools.bestMotifsOnly>` now lets you keep
      differently-named motifs that map to one locus.
    * Updated the shap code to use the latest from upstream. This is in preparation
      for eventually making it compatible with TensorFlow 2.16.
    * The :py:mod:`plots<bpreveal.tools.plots>` module is being re-worked and polished
      and it will eventually be moved to the main BPReveal repository.
BUG FIXES:
    * Fixed a CSS bug that made weird ligatures appear on the readthedocs page.
      (Patrick Moeller)
    * Set a specific version for TensorFlow and tensorflow-probability because
      TF 2.16 is MEGA BUSTED right now. I'll stick with 2.15 until there's a reason
      to upgrade.
    * Fixed a lot of little type errors in the documentation that were caught by pyright.
    * The documentation incorrectly said that there would be attributes called
      ``head-id`` and ``task-id`` in PISA hdf5 files. This has never been true, and the
      documentation now makes no mention of these fields.
    * The logic for assigning colors to motifs in plotPisa re-used colors even when there
      were unused ones in the palette. This has been fixed.
    * The destructor for ThreadedBatchPredictor could cause an error if logUtils had been
      destroyed before the object's destructor was called. It now checks for this
      situation.

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Patrick Moeller, Charles McAnany


BPReveal 4.1.3, 2024-03-24
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

NEW FEATURES:
    * You can now specify different quantile cutoffs for different patterns with the
      motif scanner. This can be useful when you have some motifs that have very low
      sequence complexity. (Charles McAnany)
    * The documentation is now auto-deployed to readthedocs. (Patrick Moeller)

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * :py:mod:`motifSeqletCutoffs<bpreveal.motifSeqletCutoffs>` will now include
      correct coordinate information as long as the modisco example indexes are correct.
      (Charles McAnany)
    * The new :py:class:`motifUtils.Seqlet<bpreveal.motifUtils.Seqlet>` class
      consolidates a bunch of random arrays that had been part of the Pattern class.
      (Charles McAnany)

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Charles McAnany, Patrick Moeller.

BPReveal 4.1.2, 2024-03-07
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * Added references to the GitHub online documentation.
    * Added the ability to specify an output file in :py:mod:`metrics<bpreveal.metrics>`.
    * Set the project's license to be GPL2+
    * Made the generator take less memory by storing the one-hot sequences as uint8
      rather than float32.
    * Added a feature to :py:class:`MiniPattern<bpreveal.motifUtils.MiniPattern>` that
      lets you scan a single region and see all of the match scores at each position.

BUG FIXES:
    * :py:mod:`tileGenome<bpreveal.tools.tileGenome>` would ignore chromosome edge
      boundaries if you specified a blacklist. This has been fixed.
    * Fixed an incorrect calculation of the receptive field in
      :py:mod:`interpretPisa<bpreveal.interpretPisa>`. The default behavior does not
      implement this fix, so you need to set ``correct-receptive-field`` to ``true``.
      Not including this flag in your config now triggers a warning, and the default
      behavior will change to use the correct receptive field in version 5.0.0.

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Charles McAnany

BPReveal 4.1.1, 2024-02-27
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

NEW FEATURES:
    * The PISA code now runs in parallel if you provide a ``num-threads`` parameter
      in its configuration file. Three-fold speedup is very possible.

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * Integrated documentation from Melanie on the motif scanning tools.
    * Separated type definitions out from the utils module into a new internal.constants
      module so that the utils documentation isn't full of type annotations.
    * Combined the old makePredictionsBed and makePredictionsFasta into a single
      makePredictions script. The old names will be removed in 6.0.0.
    * You can specify a genome name for ``background-probs`` in
      :py:mod:`motifSeqletCutoffs<bpreveal.motifSeqletCutoffs>` and
      :py:mod:`motifScan<bpreveal.motifScan>`.
    * Rewrote the generator to use a new C library, making the data loading step
      at the end of each batch about three times faster. The jitter values will be
      slightly different than before since I'm using the random number generator
      differently, but there should be no problems with backwards compatibility.
      Hooray for better GPU utilization!

BUG FIXES:
    * Fixed the name of the counts head in transformation models using bias counts from
      ``combined_log_counts_<headname>`` to ``combined_logcounts_<headname>``, making
      ``use-bias-counts`` compatible with adaptive loss and the new training progress
      logger. (Melanie Weilert)
    * Corrected a bug where non-links in the documentation still showed up as blue.
      (Thanks to Patrick Moeller for the fix!)

BPReveal 4.1.0, 2024-02-16
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

BREAKING CHANGES:
    * The output from training now has a radically different format. If you were parsing
      progress bars from log files, I hope that the new format will make your life
      easier.

NEW FEATURES:
    * Extracted the logging functions into a new module,
      :py:mod:`logUtils<bpreveal.logUtils>`. It separates BPReveal logging into
      its own class of messages, so you can still use logging with your own
      code without stepping on BPReveal's toes.
    * Removed the old progress bar logging system during training. Training now produces
      a spew of logging messages that are easier to grep, and they can be displayed in
      real time by the new :py:mod:`showTrainingProgress<bpreveal.showTrainingProgress>`
      tool. This tool requires training the model with INFO or DEBUG verbosity, otherwise
      no useful output is produced. The format of the output is still flexible and will
      not be finalized until 4.3.0.

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * Added parallelization to :py:mod:`prepareBed<bpreveal.prepareBed>`.
      It should now be a lot faster. Output is bit-for-bit identical.
    * Dramatically sped up the whitelist calculation for tiling the genome in
      :py:func:`makeWhitelistSegments<bpreveal.bedUtils.makeWhitelistSegments>`.
    * Made the verbosity of the training step match the user-specified verbosity.
      If your configuration json says that verbosity should be ``WARNING``, then there
      is much less output from the training scripts.
    * Switched the documentation to a serif font.
    * Cleaned up the documentation building process a lot.

DEPRECATIONS:
    * The showModel script is deprecated and will be removed in 6.0.0.
      It does very little and required two large dependencies (pydot and graphviz)
      to get the image out.

BUG FIXES:
    * The :py:mod:`motifAddQuantiles<bpreveal.motifAddQuantiles>` script used to add
      a new copy of quantile information if the file already had that data. Now it
      replaces the old quantile information.

CONTRIBUTORS:

BPReveal 4.0.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 4.0.4, 2024-02-07
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

BUG FIXES:
    * Fixed a bug that prevented ``null`` quantile cutoffs in
      :py:mod:`motifAddQuantiles<bpreveal.motifAddQuantiles>`.

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Charles McAnany

Version 4.0.3, 2024-01-30
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

BUG FIXES:
    * Fixed a bug in the Easy prediction function incorrectly assuming that models
      had only one output.
    * Added pydot and graphviz as optional components in the build script, only
      necessary to use the graphical output from showModel.

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Charles McAnany

Version 4.0.2, 2024-01-29
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

BREAKING CHANGES:
    * A few internal variable names were switched from snake_case to camelCase.
      This should not have any effect on code that uses BPReveal.

NEW FEATURES:
    * Added a feature to
      :py:mod:`makePredictionsFasta<bpreveal.makePredictionsFasta>` where you
      can specify a bed file and a genome. If you do, then the coordinate
      information from that bed will be saved in the output h5 and you can use
      :py:mod:`predictToBigwig<bpreveal.predictToBigwig>` with it. Added the
      same feature to interpretFlat, so you can use it with
      :py:mod:`shapToBigwig<bpreveal.shapToBigwig>`.
    * Two new functions:
      :py:func:`utils.blankChromosomeArrays<bpreveal.utils.blankChromosomeArrays>`
      and :py:func:`utils.writeBigwig<bpreveal.utils.writeBigwig>`

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * A complete overhaul of the documentation means that we now have on-line
      docs for all of the components of BPReveal, all with type annotations.
      The old overview.pdf has been removed and split up across many webpages.
    * Many functions that were previously undocumented are now
      fully-documented.
    * Automated the testing of schemas. The runTests.py script will
      automatically go through all the test cases.
    * Added new arguments to
      :py:func:`utils.loadChromSizes<bpreveal.utils.loadChromSizes`. These let
      you pass in things other than a ``chrom.sizes`` file name. You can now
      provide a genome fasta, a bigwig, and a bunch of other things.


BUG FIXES:
    * The dummy progress bar for an int passed to
      :py:func:`utils.wrapTqdm<bpreveal.utils.wrapTqdm>` returned the dummyPbar
      *class*, not an *object*. This has been fixed.

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Charles McAnany

Version 4.0.1, 2024-01-17
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

NEW FEATURES:
    * Added the option to specify the kmer size for the shuffles in shap value
      calculations. interpretFlat and interpretPisa now have an optional
      "kmer-size" parameter in their configuration jsons. If omitted, the
      default (non-kmer-preserving) shuffle is performed.
    * There are now easy functions that you can use to make predictions and get
      interpretation scores in :py:mod:`utils<bpreveal.utils>`.
    * A new
      :py:class:`ThreadedBatchPredictor<bpreveal.utils.ThreadedBatchPredictor>`
      runs predictions in another thread, and lets you hold it in a context
      manager so that it shuts down and starts up when you need it.


ENHANCEMENTS:
    * All BPReveal programs that take JSON input now check that input against a
      schema.
    * Lots of enhancements to the pisa plotting tools!

BUG FIXES:
    * :py:mod:`makePredictionsFasta<bpreveal.makePredictionsFasta>` used a
      non-iterable tqdm object as an iterable in a loop. This has been fixed.

Version 4.0.0, 2024-01-10
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

BREAKING CHANGES:
    * interpretFlat now produces h5 files that use integer indexes for the
      chromosome instead of strings. Internal programs that were affected by
      this change now emit a warning if they detect an importance file from an
      earlier release.
    * The adaptive loss is now named reweightableMse, and comes from a function
      in losses.py called weightedMse. If you're just loading a model, you can
      specify "custom_objects={'multinomialNll': losses.multinomialNll,
      'reweightableMse': losses.dummyMse}" when you call load_model in keras.
      There's also a new loadModel function in utils.py that does this for you.

DEPRECATIONS:
    * interpretPisaBed and interpretPisaFasta have been merged into one
      program, interpretPisa. Symlinks exist in the bin/ directory; using one
      will generate a warning until 6.0.0, when the symlinks will be removed.
    * interpretPisa now expects a property called "fasta-file", (consistent
      with interpretFlat), instead of the old "sequence-fasta" property. This
      will generate a warning until 6.0.0, when it will become an error.
    * The old json format for prepareBed has produced a warning since 3.3.1. It
      will be an error in 5.0.0
    * Using an old-style importance score hdf5 (with string chromosome names)
      is now a warning, and will become an error in 6.0.0.


ENHANCEMENTS:
    * All queues now have a timeout, so that a crash in one thread will
      propagate through the entire program instead of freezing.
    * Started working on json schemas to validate inputs, hopefully making
      errors less opaque. All of the programs except the motif scanners have
      schemas now. (Thanks to Melanie for lighting the fire that led to this!)
    * Plenty of code cleanups and tweaks.


BUG FIXES:
    * Fixed a typo in interpretUtils.py (Thanks, Haining!)
    * The specification incorrectly stated that the warning level of verbosity
      was "WARN", when in fact it should be "WARNING".
    * Fixed the install script to use tensorflow 2.15, which requires cuda 12.
    * The automatic memory allocation in interpretFlat
      (utils.py/limitMemoryUsage) worked incorrectly if running on a MIG gpu.
      This has been remedied with an extremely ugly hack that looks at
      CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES and sees if there's a MIG entry. If so, it estimates
      the available memory based on the MIG type's name (like 3g.20gb).

BPReveal 3.x
------------

BPReveal 3.6.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 3.6.1, 2023-12-05
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * Added a version of ushuffle that is compatible with python 3.11. This is
      now part of the main bpreveal repository, in the src/internal directory.
    * Implemented an adaptive counts loss weight algorithm, so you can specify
      the fraction of the loss due to counts instead of a raw :math:`{\lambda}`
      parameter.

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Charles McAnany


Version 3.6.0, 2023-11-06
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * The old predictToBigwig script had odd behavior with overlapping inputs.
      It always took the leftmost region that predicted a particular base and
      saved that out. Now, it instead averages all of the predictions made for
      a given base and saves the average value. This may result in small
      changes to your bigwigs, but should not cause any meaningful differences.
      predictToBigwig now has a --threads option, since I made it GO FAST LIKE
      NYOOOOM! Since this cause a change in outputs, I'm assigning a minor
      version increase, though it's really not a big deal.
    * Fully qualified the names of all the imports in all the python files, so
      they should be callable from anywhere and importable from any script now.

BUG FIXES:
    * In the specification, corrected "chrom_name" to "chrom_names" in the
      output hdf5 format for makePredictionsBed.

BPReveal 3.5.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 3.5.3, 2023-11-03
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

NEW FEATURES:
    * Added a bedUtils.py library with useful tools for manipulating bed files.

BUG FIXES:
    * Added fully qualified imports to several files, allowing you to import
      them from other directories.

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Charles McAnany

Version 3.5.2, 2023-10-26
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

NEW FEATURES:
    * Added a script to calculate the right counts loss weight given a model
      training history json.

BUG FIXES:
    * Fixed a typing bug in motifUtils that made motif scanning not work.

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Charles McAnany


Version 3.5.1, 2023-10-23
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

BUG FIXES:
    * Building conda environments is always haunted. Fixed problems with model
      training scripts not being able to find the cuda tools on Cerebro (even
      though they're found just fine on my local workstation!)

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Charles McAnany


Version 3.5.0, 2023-10-17
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

BREAKING CHANGES
    * This should not have any effects on typical uses, but BPReveal now uses
      Python 3.11.
    * Removed the compiled jaccard library, the install process now
      automatically builds it. You'll need to re-install BPReveal (or run make
      in the src directory).

NEW FEATURES:
    * Created a directory of helpful tools under src/tools. These are not part
      of BPReveal proper, but have some useful goodies for plotting and stuff.
      Pull requests welcome for new tools!
    * Added the ability to provide sequence fasta files to interpretFlat.py
      this required a total rewrite of the interpretation code to use
      streaming. interpretFlat now requires just a few gigs of memory. It also
      calculates profile and counts contribution simultaneously, leading to a
      60% speedup.
    * Created better conda integration. The BPReveal libraries should be on
      your python path when you open python, and they are in the bpreveal
      package. You can now `import bpreveal.utils` from any python interpreter.
      Also created a bin/ directory that has links to all of the BPReveal
      scripts. You should be able to just run `trainSoloModel config.json` once
      you've activated the conda environment.

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * Switched to storing importance scores as 16-bit floating point values and
      enabled hdf5 compression, leading to an 80% reduction in the size of
      contribution hdf5 files. Upgraded several components to effectively read
      and write in a compressed, block-oriented format.
    * Added type annotations to most of the library functions, allowing your
      editor to quickly check for mistakes in argument order and type.
    * Added type definitions to utils.py, so the code now (mostly) uses
      consistent definitions for variable types.
    * Updated the build scripts and added one for building a local copy of the
      BPReveal environment.

BPReveal 3.4.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 3.4.0, 2023-10-06
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

NEW FEATURES:
    * CWM scanning is now implemented. This takes the output from modisco and
      uses contribution scores to look for motif instances across the genome.
      The documentation has been updated. Thanks to Melanie Weilert for an
      initial BPReveal-compatible implementation of CWM scanning.

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Melanie Weilert, Charles McAnany


BPReveal 3.3.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 3.3.2, 2023-09-19
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

BUG FIXES:
    * Updated the conda install script to be compatible with Tensorflow 2.12.
      The tensorflow-probability package that had been installed was too old,
      so I have changed to getting tensorflow and tensorflow-probability from
      conda. The build script also installs mamba, which seemed to work better
      for me.

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Charles McAnany


Version 3.3.1, 2023-08-30
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * Added a "heads" section to prepareBed.py json files. This lets you
      combined multiple bigwigs just as you do for the final model. The old
      "bigwigs" section is now deprecated, and will be removed in BPReveal 5.0.
      Previously, if you had a two-task head, prepareBed.py would reject any
      region where *either* of those tasks was outside of your counts limits.
      The new version adds the bigwigs in each head together before doing the
      counts culling. This is useful when one track has zero reads but the
      other still has data. Thanks to Melanie for suggesting this feature.
    * Finally ran through shap.py and fixed formatting.
    * Added two features to metrics.py. First, for regions that are empty,
      metrics.py now has a feature to simply ignore those regions rather than
      using them in counts correlations (they were always ignored in profile
      correlations). Second, added a feature to generate json output for ease
      of parsing.
    * Added three utility functions to gaOptimize.py for easily converting
      lists of corruptors to and from strings and numerical arrays. Thanks to
      Haining Jiang for suggesting these.

DEPRECATIONS:
    * The "bigwigs" section in prepareBed.py json files has been deprecated and
      will become an error in BPReveal 5.0.

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Melanie Weilert, Charles McAnany.


Version 3.3.0, 2023-06-23
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

NEW FEATURES:
    * Added a genetic algorithm module. See the demo pdfs for how to use them.
    * Added a batch-running tool to utils.py, this lets you run many sequences
      through your model without worrying about constructing batches
      efficiently.

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * Rewrote makePredictionsFasta to stream data in and out. It is now quite
      fast and uses very little memory.
    * Updated the OSKN demo python notebook to be compatible with version 3.

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Charles McAnany


BPReveal 3.2.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 3.2.0, 2023-05-17
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

NEW FEATURES:
    * Previously, if a solo model had a different input length than the
      residual model, you could not combine them. Melanie added logic so that
      if the solo model has a smaller input length (for example, because it has
      fewer layers), the sequence will automatically be cropped down to match
      it. In this way, you don't have to match solo and residual architectures
      any more.

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * Further re-formatting to comply with PEP8.

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Melanie Weilert (cropdown logic), Charles McAnany (code cleanup)

BPReveal 3.1.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 3.1.0, 2023-05-14
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

NEW FEATURES:
    * Added an automatic reverse complement strand selection feature. Instead
      of saying '"revcomp-task-order" : [1,0]', you can now say
      '"revcomp-task-order":"auto"' when you have one or two tasks in a head.

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * Code cleanup in general, such as removing unused imports and tidying up
      formatting.

BUG FIXES:
    * Fixed a missing import in prepareBed.py that broke the regex mode.

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Charles McAnany


BPReveal 3.0.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 3.0.1, 2023-04-26
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * Formatted the code throughout the repository to more closely comply with
      PEP8.

BUG FIXES:
    * Fixed a bug in argument order for deduplicating in prepareBed.py

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Charles McAnany

Version 3.0.0, 2023-03-10
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

BREAKING CHANGES:
    * There is a new "remove-overlaps" field that is mandatory in prepareBed.py
      json files. If set to true, then you can set how close two peaks must be
      before they are considered overlapping. (Thanks to Melanie Weilert for
      the implementation.)
    * On discussion with Melanie, it occurred that the cropdown feature of the
      transformation model is never appropriate. Therefore, this feature has
      been removed.  Instead, in a future version, there will be a feature to
      crop down the input sequence to the solo model during training the
      combined model. (Charles McAnany)
    * Since there is no cropping, it was silly to call the input-length
      "sequence-input-length" inside the transformation config json. It is now
      sensibly called "input-length".

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * The PISA code was totally rewritten; it now uses a streaming architecture
      so that loading the data, calculating shap scores, and saving data are
      done by different threads. This cuts way down on memory use, and makes it
      possible to run pisa over an entire genome. (generating 100 GiB per
      megabase or so.) (Charles McAnany)

BUG FIXES:
    * In the combined config, the documentation called a parameter
      "output-directory", but the code expected "output-prefix". The
      documentation has been corrected. (Charles McAnany)

BPReveal 2.x
------------

BPReveal 2.0.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 2.0.2, 2023-02-17
'''''''''''''''''''''''''
ENHANCEMENTS:
    * interpretPisaBed.py will now include predictions and reference
      predictions in the output hdf5.

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Charles McAnany


Version 2.0.1, 2023-02-09
'''''''''''''''''''''''''
ENHANCEMENTS:
    * prepareBed.py will no longer replace the names in your bed files; the
      generated files will have the same names as the input beds. (Suggested by
      Melanie)

CONTRIBUTORS:
    Melanie Weilert, Charles McAnany


Version 2.0.0, 2023-02-07
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

BREAKING CHANGES:
    * Added a reverse-complement flag to prepareTrainingData.py. If this is set
      to true, then you must specify strand mappings to each of the heads in
      that file. If you want your code to behave like before, just set
      "reverse-complement" to false in the json file for
      prepareTrainingData.py.

ENHANCEMENTS:
    * Reverse complement support added, see overview.tex in the section on
      prepareTrainingData.py. (Charles McAnany)
