# Version specification:
# Versions are named as [major].[minor].[patch]
# A major version change implies that backwards compatibility will be broken for many
# uses. Data formats on disk may change, and new mandatory parameters may be included in
# configuration files. All previous files and models are invalid after a major version
# change.

# A minor version change could alter the API and break some code that digs deep into
# BPReveal. Any configuration files will remain valid, and all data files remain valid.
# The minor version can also be incremented when a significant new feature is added.
# If any changes are made to the conda environment (new python version,
# different install procedure, etc.), then the minor version will be incremented.

# A patch change will not break any existing code and does not alter any publicly-usable
# API. New minor features and bug fixes will cause patch increments. Patch increments
# will not alter the environment setup, so you can just pull the new BPReveal code
# and it will work with your current conda environment.
