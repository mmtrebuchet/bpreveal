    :param heads: The heads section from a configuration file.
    :return: A tuple. The first element contains the losses, and the second contains the
        loss weights.

    This method injects the λ parameter used for the adaptive loss algorithm into the
    heads data structure. After this function is done, each head in heads will contain
    #ifdef MAN_PAGE
    a member called ``INTERNAL_λ-variable``. This is an actual TensorFlow
    #else
    a member called :math:`\tt INTERNAL\_\lambda{}\text{-}variable`. This is an actual TensorFlow
    #endif
    variable, and it is hooked in to the counts loss so that the adaptive loss callback
    (which also gets a copy of ``heads``) can adjust it during training.

    Returns a 2-tuple, structured so:

    1. A list of all the profile losses followed by all the counts losses:
        ``profLoss1, profLoss2, ... profLossN, countsLoss1, countsLoss2, ... countsLossN``
    2. A list of all the loss weights.
        Since the counts loss weight is included in the actual loss function,
        the weights that are given to the Keras training routine are all ones
        for the counts. The profile loss weights are taken straight from your
        json.
