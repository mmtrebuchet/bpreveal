    This implements the formula in the modisco paper, namely that

        J(v_1,v_2) = \frac{\sum_i (v_{1,i} \cap v_{2,i})}{\sum_i (v_{1,i} \cup v_{2,i})}

    .. math::

        x \cap y &= min(|x|, |y|) * sign(x) * sign(y) \\
        x \cup y &= max(|x|, |y|)

    The scaleFactor is a number that the importanceScores array should be multiplied by.
    If you just want the continuous Jaccard metric, set this to 1.0.
