# BPReveal
BPReveal is a suite of tools for building and interpreting sequence-to-profile
models of biological data. The model architectures are based on chrombpnet,
which is in turn based on BPNet. It incorporates PISA analysis, which extracts
pairwise interactions between every base in a model's input and each one of
its outputs.

You can find the documentation [here](https://bpreveal.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

# Components
BPReveal is designed as a set of command-line tools that can be flexibly
combined for many analysis tasks. A precise specification for each tool can be
found in the documentation.

You can find a tutorial for training a model on transcription factor data in
mouse in [this document](doc/demos/osknExample.pdf)

## Organization
BPReveal follows a traditional Unix-style directory structure:
- `bin` contains the executables. This is added to your path when you use one
  of the provided scripts to build a conda environment.
- `doc` contains examples of using the package along with a formal
  specification of all the file types and programs.
    - `doc/demos` contains demonstrations of fun things you can do with
      BPReveal.
    - `doc/presentations` contains (you guessed it!) presentations related to
      BPReveal.
- `pkg` is a silly folder that is added to your python search path, letting you
  `import bpreveal.utils` without having to mess about with $PYTHONPATH. You
  can ignore it.
- `src` contains all the programs.
    - `src/schematools` contains the json schema that are used to validate the
      input to the programs.
    - `src/internal` contains source code that must be compiled using the f2py
      routines in numpy.
    - `src/tools` contains a hodgepodge of scripts that are useful for specific
      tasks. These are not actively maintained and tested, but may be useful.
- `test` contains the files that are used in the demonstration notebooks. Note
  that `test` is not committed to the git repository - it's many gigabytes of
  data files. If you're on the Stowers network, you can find this directory at
  `/n/projects/cm2363/bpreveal/test`.


## Documentation

The readthedocs documentation is kept relatively current, but you can easily get
your own local copy.
The BPReveal project uses Sphinx to generate documentation. If you want to build
the documentation, make sure that `INSTALL_DEVTOOLS=true` in the install script,
then run `make html` or `make latexpdf` in the doc directory.
Documentation will be in
`doc/_build/html/index.html` or `doc/_build/latex/bpreveal.pdf`.

If you're at Stowers, then the documentation will be included in the
repositories that I maintain at /n/projects/cm2363/public-bpreveal/<version>/doc.

## Installing
To install BPReveal, EDIT and then run one of the `buildConda` scripts in the
root directory. If you're using the Cerebro cluster at Stowers, run
`buildCondaCerebro.slurm`. If you're installing BPReveal on a local machine,
run `buildCondaLocal.zsh`.
If you're at Stowers, you can just activate one of the conda environments I
maintain at /n/projects/cm2363/public-bpreveal/<version>/env.
